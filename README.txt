# MyProjects
My personal programming projects.

NOTE: when using programs that utilize text files, you must edit 
the path of such files in the code (which are included in this 
repository, of course)

Programs ending in .py can be downloaded and run through Terminal,
Command Prompt or any IDE. Other programs, such as db.sqlite, are
not needed by the user (they will be automatically generated).

MISC = random programs
NEWS = news-based programs
DATA = .txt files
